Identify the two questions about the dataset on your own. You might change your questions after you explore the data further.

Do students who study more have better grades?
The answer is yes. When I sorted the data from best performance index(a number to indicate how much better the scored from the first to second test) to worst, we can see that the best students studied for 9 hours and the worst only 1 or 2 hours.

Does the ammount of sleep a student has affect their score?
This question has a more complicated answer. The top three performers had different ammounts of sleep: 7, 8, and 4 hours. Because two out of the three slept more than 6 hours we can assume that having a good amount of sleep helps with testing but isn't the main factor in getting a good grade.


Do students who do extracirriculars study less and/or get worse scores?
More of the top performing students did extracurricular activities. So these activities did not have a negative impact on their grades and study time.


Write a program in any programming language using a statistics library (e.g. R or Python Pandas) to analyze the dataset and provide an answer to your questions.



You must demonstrate the ability to do one or more of the following to achieve each answer: filter, sort, aggregate (sum, average, count), or data conversion.



While there is no right or wrong answer, your answer should be justified by your analysis.
