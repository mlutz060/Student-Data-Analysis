I decided to do a Data Analysis study and teach myself the basics about pandas and some of the libraries you can use with it. The dataset I chose was a simple onf about students. The students were given two tests and in between it was recorded how many hours they studied, how many hours they slept a night, and if they participated in extracirricular activities. Then taking the two scores a performance index was created. I decided to find the answers to three questions(listed below).

My main purpose in writing this software was to teach myself about data analysis and practice with a programming topic that I haven't had any experience with in school.

# Data Analysis Results

Do students who study more have better grades?
The answer is yes. When I sorted the data from best performance index(a number to indicate how much better the scored from the first to second test) to worst, we can see that the best students studied for 9 hours and the worst only 1 or 2 hours.

Does the ammount of sleep a student has affect their score?
This question has a more complicated answer. The top three performers had different ammounts of sleep: 7, 8, and 4 hours. Because two out of the three slept more than 6 hours we can assume that having a good amount of sleep helps with testing but isn't the main factor in getting a good grade.


Do students who do extracirriculars study less and/or get worse scores?
More of the top performing students did extracurricular activities. So these activities did not have a negative impact on their grades and study time.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write this software.
This program was written in Python using the pandas and matplotlib libraries for analysis and graphing.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* First I wasn's able to get the graph to look the way I inteded it to and that's definetly something I want to work on and fix.
* I want to figure out how to get specific averages of columns. For example an average of the highest score to the median.
* I would like to learn and implement more ways to analyze the data.
